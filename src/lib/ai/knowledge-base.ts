1. **Open the booking form.** Click the purple **"Book Security"** button at the bottom of the left sidebar, or use **Book Security** in Quick Actions on your Overview page.
2. **Step 1 – Event Details.** Enter the event name, the date, the start and end time, and choose where it's happening (your saved venue address or a new location).
3. **Step 2 – Staff Requirements.** Add the role(s) you need (e.g. Door Supervisor, Security Guard), how many guards for each role, and the hourly rate you'll pay.
4. **Step 3 – Select Staff.** Either let any available, verified guard accept the job, or hand-pick specific staff / your Preferred Staff.
5. **Step 4 – Review.** Check the summary — dates, roles, guards, and total cost.
6. **Step 5 – Payment.** Pay securely with card. **As soon as payment goes through, your job goes live** and matching guards are notified.

After that, your booking appears under **Bookings** (in the "Bookings & Events" menu), where you can track who has accepted and confirmed.

**Tip:** The Next button stays disabled until each step is complete, and it tells you exactly what's missing (e.g. "Pick a date"). To reuse a setup for recurring events, save it as an **Event Template**.`,

    content: `**Set up payouts:** Open the **Payments** page and connect your bank details so Shield can pay you. You need this set up before you can receive money for shifts.

**How payment works:** When you complete a shift, payment is released for the hours you worked. It then transfers to the bank account you connected.

**Track what you've earned:** The **Earnings** page shows your completed shifts, total earnings and payment history in one place — useful for budgeting and tax records.

If a payment looks wrong, check the shift was marked complete (checked out) and that your bank details on the Payments page are correct.`,

**Upload your documents:**
1. Open the **Documents** page from the left sidebar.
2. Upload your **SIA licence** and **ID**, plus any extra certifications (First Aid, etc.).
3. Once reviewed, your profile shows as verified, and venues are far more likely to book you.

**Your Shield Score** is a reliability rating (0–100). It goes up when you're verified, keep your details current, turn up on time, check in/out properly and get good reviews. A higher score means you appear higher to venues and win more work. See it on the **Shield Score** page.

**Intro video:** Some roles let you add a short intro video to stand out — look for that option on your profile.`,

**If you're SECURITY PERSONNEL:** Your job is to win and complete shifts. Start with **Find Shifts** to pick up work, set your **Availability**, upload your documents on the **Documents** page to get verified, and check in from the mobile app on the day.
