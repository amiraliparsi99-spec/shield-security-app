/**
 * ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country list, optimised for the Shield HQ flow.
 *
 * - GB pinned to top because that's still ~100% of real usage today.
 * - The "common neighbours" (IE, LU, FR, DE, ES, IT, NL, BE) sit just below.
 * - Full list follows alphabetically.
 *
 * The `code` field is uppercase to match the DB's `CHAR(2)` (e.g. "GB", "LU").
 * Mapbox uses lowercase ISO codes, so always `toLowerCase()` before sending
 * to the geocode API.
